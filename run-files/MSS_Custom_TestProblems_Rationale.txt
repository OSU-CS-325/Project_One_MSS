The file "MSS_Custom_TestProblems.txt" contains several test cases used in
addition to the provided test set. This file contains the rationale for the 
chosen test cases.

1. Single element array. This is the trivial case.

2. All positive elements. Included to test where entire array is the maximum
	sub-array.

3. Left-most element is the only positive element. Included to test a single
	positive element at the boundaries.

4. Right-most element is the only positive element. Included to test a single
	positive element at the boundaries.

5. Center element is the only positive element. Included to test a single 
	positive element in the middle of the array.

6. Running sum temporarily equals zero before increasing to maximum sum. 
	Included to test that logic conditions are correctly handled in the linear
	algorithm.
